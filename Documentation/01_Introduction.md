# Introduction to Niruv

**Niruv** is a minimal, lightweight desktop shell built for the [Niri](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri) Wayland compositor. It leverages the power of [Quickshell](https://quickshell.outfoxxed.me/) (Qt/QML) to provide a beautiful, responsive, and highly customizable user interface.

The name **Niruv** is a portmanteau of **Niri** and **Gruv**box, and also references the Sanskrit word **निरव** (*nirav*), meaning "quiet" or "silent." This reflects the shell's core design philosophy: to be unobtrusive, calm, and focused.
